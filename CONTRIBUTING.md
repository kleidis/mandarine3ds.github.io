# Contributing Guidelines

## Common

### Commit Style

We generally follow simple plain-English commit titles and summaries, which encapsulate what a commit has done. We don't use a distinct commit style like that of the Linux Kernel for any commits and they would look extremely out of place in the repository overall.

In addition, we stick to a single objective with one commit. Make sure that the scope isn't too small so there'll be a huge amount of commits, or too large so it's a single commit that changes vast swaths of the codebase. Try to find the right balance between committing too less and too much.

### Use line-wrapping

There is no column limit in the codebase, this is so that the line width can adjust to everyone's display size using line-wrap. Do not manually wrap lines unless it can be done in a natural way and is needed at all, let line-wrap handle it for you.

### Use code formatter

Visual Studio Code comes with a code formatter in-built, this can fix minor mistakes in code-style. To reformat code:

-   On Windows Shift + Alt + F.
-   On Mac Shift + Option + F.
-   On Linux Ctrl + Shift + I.
